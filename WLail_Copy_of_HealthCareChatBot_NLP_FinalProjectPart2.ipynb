Of the one to four million Americans who have CFS, less than 20% have been diagnosed.\\n  Exams and Screening Tests for CFS\\n  \\nBecause there is no blood test, brain scan, or other lab test to diagnose CFS, the doctor should first rule out other possible causes.\\n  \\nIf a patient has had 6 or more consecutive months of severe fatigue that is reported to be unrelieved by sufficient bed rest and that is accompanied by nonspecific symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, generalized pain, and memory problems, the doctor should consider the possibility that the patient may have CFS. Further exams and tests are needed before a diagnosis can be made:\\n  \\n   - A detailed medical history will be needed and should include a review of medications that could be causing the fatigue and symptoms\\n   - A thorough physical and mental status examination will also be needed\\n   - A battery of laboratory screening tests will be needed to help identify or rule out other possible causes of the symptoms that could be treated\\n   - The doctor may also order additional tests to follow up on results of the initial screening tests\\n  \\n  \\nA CFS diagnosis requires that the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more and has 4 of the 8 symptoms for CFS for 6 months or more. If, however, the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more but does not have four of the eight symptoms, the diagnosis may be idiopathic fatigue.\\n  \\nThe complete process for diagnosing CFS can be found here.\\n  \\nAdditional information for healthcare professionals on use of tests can be found here.\",\n          \"Eating, diet, and nutrition have not been shown to play a role in causing or preventing simple kidney cysts.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Of the one to four million Americans who have CFS, less than 20% have been diagnosed.\\n  Exams and Screening Tests for CFS\\n  \\nBecause there is no blood test, brain scan, or other lab test to diagnose CFS, the doctor should first rule out other possible causes.\\n  \\nIf a patient has had 6 or more consecutive months of severe fatigue that is reported to be unrelieved by sufficient bed rest and that is accompanied by nonspecific symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, generalized pain, and memory problems, the doctor should consider the possibility that the patient may have CFS. Further exams and tests are needed before a diagnosis can be made:\\n  \\n   - A detailed medical history will be needed and should include a review of medications that could be causing the fatigue and symptoms\\n   - A thorough physical and mental status examination will also be needed\\n   - A battery of laboratory screening tests will be needed to help identify or rule out other possible causes of the symptoms that could be treated\\n   - The doctor may also order additional tests to follow up on results of the initial screening tests\\n  \\n  \\nA CFS diagnosis requires that the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more and has 4 of the 8 symptoms for CFS for 6 months or more. If, however, the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more but does not have four of the eight symptoms, the diagnosis may be idiopathic fatigue.\\n  \\nThe complete process for diagnosing CFS can be found here.\\n  \\nAdditional information for healthcare professionals on use of tests can be found here.\",\n          \"Eating, diet, and nutrition have not been shown to play a role in causing or preventing simple kidney cysts.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question_cleansed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14202,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"genetic changes related hereditary hyperekplexia\",\n          \"symptoms rhabdoid tumor\",\n          \"microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type ii inherited\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer_cleansed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15255,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has no cure.\",\n          \"What are the signs and symptoms of Dent disease 1?

Also, it seemed to be limited to chronological or sequential conversational order. Whereas our use case is a body of questions and answers that someone may ask any question not in a specific order.\n",
